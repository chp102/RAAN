# RAAN Case Study Interns

<i>In the link I sent by email, you can find my article about this work, with deeper explanations.</i>

In this repository you can find:
- The 2D visualization
- The 3D Interactive visualization
- The Jupyter Notebook (Python) I created which contains all the code that I wrote to generate both the visualizations, create the web application and upload it into my hosting account.

## Notes:
- The notebook has been tested both in "Google Colab" and "Jupiter" environments.
- In order to optimize the compatibility of the notebook, it needs to install different packages, so it may take a few to completely run.
- If you use the online runnable notebook (link in the article) it will be imported in "Binder" from my GitHub repo, please be patient while it set up the whole online environment.


## How to run the Python Notebook?
<i>Note:  you don't need to import the dataset, since it will be automatically imported from my GoogleDrive into the Notebook when you run it.</i>

You can choose to run the notebook using different environments.
