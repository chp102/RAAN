# RAAN Case Study Interns

<i>In the link I sent by email, you can find my article about this work, with deeper explanations.</i>

In this repository you can find:
- The 2D visualization
- The 3D Interactive visualization
- The Jupyter Notebook (Python) I created which contains all the code that I wrote to generate both the visualizations, create the web application and upload it into my hosting account.


## How to run the Jupyter Notebook (Python)?
<i>Note:  you don't need to import the dataset, since it will be automatically imported from my GoogleDrive into the Notebook when you run it.</i>

You can choose to run the notebook using different environments.
